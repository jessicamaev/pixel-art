# Pixel Art Maker Portfolio

Welcome to my Pixel Art Maker project! This portfolio showcases my journey in creating a pixel art maker inspired by a tutorial I found on YouTube. It's a fun and creative project that allowed me to dive into the world of web development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Project Overview
The Pixel Art Maker is a web-based application that lets users create pixelated artworks by coloring individual pixels on a grid. The project is built using the following technologies:
* HTML: The structure of the web page, including the grid and user interface.
* CSS: Styling to make the pixel art maker visually appealing and user-friendly.
* JavaScript: The interactive functionality that enables users to draw and erase pixels with ease.

## Features
* Grid Creation: Generate a customizable grid to define the canvas for your pixel art.
* Drawing and Erasing: Use the drawing tool to colour pixels or the eraser to remove colours.
* Colour Palette: Choose from a variety of colours to bring your pixel art to life.
* Responsive Design: Enjoy a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How to Use
1. Access the Pixel Art Maker by opening index.html in your web browser.
2. Adjust the grid size to your preference.
3. Select colours from the palette.
4. Start creating pixel art by clicking on the grid cells.
5. Feel free to explore and unleash your creativity with the Pixel Art Maker!
