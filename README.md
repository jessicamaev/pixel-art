##Pixel Art Maker Portfolio

Welcome to my Pixel Art Maker project! This portfolio showcases my journey in creating a pixel art maker inspired by a tutorial I found on YouTube. It's a fun and creative project that allowed me to dive into the world of web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
